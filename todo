! Implement CoGAN.
Figure out adda stopping criterion.
Implement adda stopping criterion.
Read DSN, a reconstruction network.
- Finish writing DADNN review till ADDA.
- Review CoGAN, look at how it's implemented.
- Validation with unweighted dataset.
- Run 3 models on RXRA TF data.
- Run 3 models on CEBPA TF data.
- Run 3 models on HNF4A TF data.
- DANN debugging to know src and tgt scores after each epoch.
- DANN debugging change batch size.
- Separate test and evaluation functions, samplers.
- Adda no need for training source, use hybrid model training weights.
Create a CLI for hybrid, dann, adda training
Bound-Unbound sites results.
Include FP,FN,TP,TN in your analysis. Also include how many changed from FP -> TP, FN -> TN and vice versa.
